Hello my name is Erik De Luna, and I'm a full time web developer.
My inspiration tends to draw from my curiousity in machines/Ai. I think the subject is so interesting, and unknown.
I come from a Audio Engineering background which I intend to apply into this exciting field. I was born in Monterrey, Mexico. Monterrey is a northern city in Mexico. I spent the first half of my childhood there. The second half of my childhood was spent in Austin, Texas where I've spent the rest of my years. What excites me most about working as a developer is, working together in a collaborative space to create a solution for a better tomorrow. Send me a email directly if you wish to drop a line, cheers!
